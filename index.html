                <h2>Welcome to our survival predictor!</h2>
                <p>
                    If you or a loved one have been diagnosed with a major sickness or are about to undergo a major surgery
                    and are looking for some clarity on your future, this is the tool that you can use to help shed more
                    light on your current situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We know that in many cases, doctors give very vague survival chances, often framing things in vague
                    terms like 5-year survival rates which are general and confusing, or stating that they do not know.
                    They do this for a reason, fearing lawsuits and confrontation from the patient and their families,
                    or sometimes, they simply don’t know as every patient is unique and their case different.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, this tool lets you know exactly what percentage of survival you have given your exact conditions
                    based on existing patient data — with no qualms or misgivings about fear of being sued, since it is all
                    technically just math in the background. Keep in mind that this is based on a machine learning model,
                    and that computers do make mistakes as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dataset used to train this model comes from KoreanVitalDB — nearly 10,000 patients in this dataset
                    were diagnosed with diseases ranging from kidney stones, wounds, to cancer, so there is a very reliable
                    sample size and diversity of data.
